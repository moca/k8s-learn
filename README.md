# About this repo 🎒

This repo is a compilation of notes based on my learning path towards the *Certified Kubernetes Application Developer* (CKAD) certification.

Each folder encompasses a learning subject. By the exception of chapter 0, which is the *cuisine* to get a K8s cluster up and running !

*Note: This repo is a way to keep notes of the Linux Academy course.*

# TODO 📝

 - Add readme for chapter 1 and 2.
