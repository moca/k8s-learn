# About this repo

This repo is a compilation of notes based on my learning path towards the *Certified Kubernetes Application Developer* (CKAD) certification.

Each folder encompasses a learning subject, as following the certification. By the exception of chapter 0, which is the *cuisine* to get a K8s cluster up and running !

This repo is a way to keep notes of the Linux Academy course.

# TODO

 - Add readme for chapter 1 and 2.
